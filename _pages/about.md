Hi there, my name is <strong>Giang Pham</strong> and I am a full-time <strong>Software Developer</strong> currently working for an ICT company based in Newcastle, Australia. I graduated with a Bachelor of Information Technology degree majoring in Software Development and Applications from the University of Newcastle. Software Development has always been my primary focus and inspiration since I was 17. During my study at university I had the opportunity to expose my knowledge, I did Java, C, Python, and a number of front end technologies. However, when I was in the last year of study, one of the final projects was required to be developed in the .NET platform, and from that time, I started coding in C# up until now. I was employed not long after graduation, my day-to-day duties at company are: 
* Researching, analyzing and evaluating system requirements,
* Defining the overall structure, and designing solutions to meet system requirements,
* Writing and maintaining program code in C# in .NET framework conforming with object-oriented design principles and best practices to meet system requirements and technical specifications,
* Designing and implementing normalized data schemas in Microsoft SQL Server,
* Diagnosing and debugging faults in systems built in .NET and Azure,
* Ensuring all code are fully tested prior to deployment, using popular testing frameworks such XUnit and Selenium
* Practicing design patterns in writing program code
* Practicing Test Driven Development, Behavior Driven Development in writing unit tests,
* Creating and maintaining system documentation to support technical staff and end users,
* Interacting directly with other developers and Development Manager

I decided to create this site for various reasons. I believe sharing the knowledge I learned with others is as important as learning something new. I am currently focusing on Microsoft stacks so this site will contain all the information about Microsoft technologies, from .NET/NET Core, C#, ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core MVC to Cloud Computing including Azure and many more. I will also dig into Data Engineering, things like Microsoft SQL Server, Big Data, Data Warehousing will also be mentioned. 

Although web development is not my main focus but we’ll definitely touch it somehow so I’ll address them along the way. 

This site was built with GitHub Pages and a popular version control system - GIT so I’ll refer to GIT, CI in some of my blogs as well. 

This is the first time I'm writting blogs. I hope you'll find something useful on this site.
