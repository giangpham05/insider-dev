Hi there, my name is <strong>Giang Pham</strong> and I am a full-time <strong>software developer</strong> for an ICT company based in Newcastle, Australia. I graduated in 2016 from the University of Newcastle with a Bachelor of information Technology degree majoring in Software Development and Applications. I have been programming since I was 17. My primary focus and inspiration is Software Development. Having highly skills in software development, especially in the Microsoft platform, I was employed soon not long after graduated and currently working with Microsoft stacks. My day-to-day duties at company are: 
* Researching, analyzing and evaluating system requirements,
* Defining the overall structure, and design solutions to meet system requirements,
* Writing and maintaining program code in C# in .NET framework conforming with object-oriented design principles and best practices to meet system requirements and technical specifications,
* Designing and implementing normalized data schemas in Microsoft SQL Server,
* Diagnosing and debugging faults in systems built in .NET and Azure,
* Ensuring all code are fully tested prior to deployment, using popular testing frameworks such XUnit and Selenium
* Practicing design patterns in writing program code
* Practicing Test Driven Development, Behavior Driven Development in writing unit tests,
* Creating and maintaining system documentation to support technical staff and end users,
* Interacting directly with other developers and Development Manager

I decided to create this site to share the knowledge that I learned throughout my entire career. I am currently focusing on Microsoft stacks so this site will contains all the information about Microsoft technologies, from .NET/NET Core, C# , ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core MVC to Cloud Computing including Azure and many more. I will also dig into data engineering, things like SQL Queries, big data, data warehousing will also be mentioned. 

Although web development is not my mainly focus but we’ll definitely touch it somehow so I’ll address them along the way. 

This site was built with GitHub Pages and a popular version control system - GIT so I’ll refer to GIT, CI and DI in some of my blogs as well.
